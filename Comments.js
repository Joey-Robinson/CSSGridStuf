// My package.json file is pretty wacky right now. I'm going to have to update it to see if I can remove the "one:won" script
// And just rely on npm start. Forcing someone to use both scripts is unintuitive and unreasonable

// I've given some thought into using reach-router (https://github.com/reach/router), but I want to study that a bit more before
// Making that plunge. One thing I'm going to try here, which I haven't done in a live site is minimal media queries.
// I oftentimes find myself overusing media queries, but I think that's due to a lack of CSS capabilities. This next project
// (As well as every project afterwards) will make use of CSS Grid. Flex is amazing, but Grid is so fluid. 

// As well as using minimal media queries, I'm going to aim for minimal usage of external libraries as well (eg: materialize)
// I personally feel I've been using them too much when I can learn more by simply making the item myself. Example: making a modal
// I was relying too heavily on react-modal instead of just making one myself.
